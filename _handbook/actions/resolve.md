## What it does

`{{ page.title }}` closes a report without a strike or penalty for the
account.

You can (and should) choose the `Resolve with note` option further down the
page. This provides handy context for if a situation escalates, which
initially deserved no other action.

## Is it reversible?

Yes. Reports can be re-opened.

## When to use `{{ page.title }}`

`{{ page.title }}` is a `Deferred` action. It should be used for:

{% include handbook/scenarios.md %}

If with the assistance of other moderators, you are unable to identify any
cause to use another action, use this one.
