Actions are steps you can take in the Moderation UI to manage both local and
external users.

Some of these actions are reversible, but some can have permanent
consequences, so it is important to understand what each of these actions do.

Each action described in here has been categorized with a severity level.
These severity levels will correspond with example scenarios where the actions
are a valid option, and those examples will be listed on each action's page.
