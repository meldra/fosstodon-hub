This section outlines a variety of scenarios that are likely to occur. Each
scenario will explain things you should consider before deciding on which
action you should take for it.

When considering the options, keep the values in [The Team Covenant](/covenant/)
in mind, and remember that every situation is different.

Similar to the action section, each example scenario described in here has
been categorized with a severity level that will correspond with potential
actions to take. Those actions will be listed on each scenario's page.

Some situations may be similar but very different, and the recommended actions
may not seem right. If you can coherently explain why to use a different
action, then it is ok to do so.

Unless a situation is causing a lot of harm, you should make use of warnings
for **local** users before more serious actions.

If a warning does not work, then choose an action that will use the minimum
amount of force to stop the problem. You are allowed to change your mind and
escalate to a more severe action later with more information and guidance.
