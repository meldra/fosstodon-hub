## What does it look like?

Bigotry is the expression of unreasonable prejudice on the basis of another
individual's (typically immutable) characteristics. Discriminatory behavior is
centered around notions of superiority, purity culture, or coercing people to
conform to outdated or exclusionary ideals.

Slurs, denigrating language, or insulting people based on characteristics
rather than any tangible harms caused are common with bigotry and discrimination.

People often uses tactics like [dog whistles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog_whistle_(politics))
to make their bigotry blend in with socially acceptable discourse. Sometimes
dog whistles are as simple and announcing oddly specific preferences.

Identifying a source of bigoted behavior that causes harm is not bigotry or
denigrating language. Since bigotry aims to conserve existing institutional
and political oppressions, there is no such thing as "reverse" bigotry.
Claims of reverse bigotry are a [DARVO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DARVO)
tactic.

## What is the risk?

Bigots are unpleasant people to have in a community. Their discriminatory
behavior will alienate both those whom they target, and those who support the
people who are harmed.

The continued presence of bigots will make people leave the community for
safety, and others to assume that their behavior is welcomed. This is the
[paradox of tolerance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox_of_tolerance)
and causes the [nazi bar](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Nazi_bar) problem.

## Is user-level moderation sufficient?

User-level moderation may be useful up to a point, but instance-level
moderation is necessary for community safety.
