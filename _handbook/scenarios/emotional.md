## What does it look like?

People use social media for all kinds of communication. This means both happy
and unhappy content.

It is healthy for people to be able to express anger in public.

## What is the risk?

Occasional outbursts are unlikely to be noticed.

An account that is exclusively screaming into the void and lashing out about
things that are not relevant to the audience will make public feeds less
enjoyable.

## Is user-level moderation sufficient?

If the posts are infrequent and the user isn't evading blocks, then others can
manage the problem with their account tools. Pushing back on emotional
outbursts from a place of power is tone policing and that will inflame
matters and erode trust.

If the posts are frequent enough for regular complaints, then gentle outreach
or instance-level actions may be needed, but the situation should be
evaluated as a team.
