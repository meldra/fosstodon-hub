## What does it look like?

Dealing with threatening and inciteful language is complicated. Many common
turns of phrase can seem like threats or incitement in some contexts. Most
people don't proof-read their social media posts.

A statement of intention to cause a harm to a party is a threat. It may or may
not be a credible one.

Statements *wishing* harm to public figures or groups can be
[stochastic incitement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic#Social_sciences)
*if* the author has a sizable platform or fanbase, or they are clearly seeking
others' agreement. Otherwise, they can be a valid protest. Context and
influence matters a lot.

Cursing out an individual or group is not a threat.

## What is the risk?

Threats can make people fearful, and can silence constructive dialog.

## Is user-level moderation sufficient?

No.

Credible or otherwise, a threat should always be fixed in the same way;
unpublishing the post as soon as possible.

A borderline situation may be approached with less severe measures.

Once you have done that, you can decide with the rest of the mod team as to
the user's motive and whether to escalate your action.
