## What does it look like?

Scams are public posts or private mentions which are intended to trick other
users. Scams are frequently broadcast very publicly; they may mention specific
(often popular) accounts, or be sent as replies to busy threads. They can also
be very targetted, and only the recipients know that they are happening.

Scams tend to ofter something valuable such as money, or continued access to
the user's accounts. They may also impersonate important parties, such as the
instance moderation team.

Links to mispelled or unrelated domains are very common in scam messages.

## What is the risk?

With scams, the longer that the messages are visible, the more people they can
trick.

You may not see all the account's scam messages due to how federation works,
so it is hard to remove all the messages just by deleting them. It is likely
that users can come across other scam messages in the future, which you could
not see to delete.

## Is user-level moderation sufficient?

Since block evasion is common with this kind of activity, the use of personal
blocklists is not sustainable. Acting at a server level reduces the work for
many individuals.
