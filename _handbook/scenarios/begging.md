## What does it look like?

People use social media for all kinds of fundraising. We sadly live in a world
where crowdfunding is the only option some people have. Sometimes the people
doing this will specifically target random individuals they do not know, to
request assistance. Their stories are often heartbreaking.

People doing this will often have alternate accounts on multiple instances,
and contact the same people from multiple places. Their targets are commonly
popular accounts and well-known personalities.

## What is the risk?

Being bombarded with requests for assistance is emotionally draining. It can
lead to user fatigue, and cause them to avoid using the platform.

For many people, especially those who have experienced, or who are currently
experiencing financial hardship, personally addressed pleas can be bad for
their mental health. This can have consequences like
[survivor's guilt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivor_guilt).

## Is user-level moderation sufficient?

Since block evasion is common with this kind of activity, the use of personal
blocklists is not sustainable. Acting at a server level reduces the work for
many individuals.
