## What does it look like?

Commerce is a key part of The Internet, and social media platforms have always
contained elements of it in the form of promotional posts. Most of these are
not published at the platform level, but instead by individual users offering
goods or services.

Most groups and people who advertise do occasional promotions alongside or
within other content of value and relevance, which is not generally a problem.

However there are always parties who will go overboard and inundate feeds with
a torrent of advertising. This is bad and it is called spamming.

## What is the risk?

Generally there is no risk in allowing people to post occasional promotional
content where it is relevent and valued by the community.

An account that is mostly or only about advertising, regardless of whether it
is relevant to the topic of the community can make the community less
enjoyable. People may not be able to find the content they are here for due to
the volume of spam, and leave.

## Is user-level moderation sufficient?

When the the posts are infrequent and the poster is not evading blocks,
then users can manage the problem with their account tools.

If the posts are frequent enough for regular complaints, or appearing from
multiple different instances, then instance-level moderation may be needed.
