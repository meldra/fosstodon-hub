## What does it look like?

Engagement farming can vary a lot. It can be:

- Posting eye-candy images (often of conventionally attractive women) with no
  other meaningful content.
- Showing up in multiple threads or mentioning other users (often popular
  personalities) with vague questions that are usually not relevant to the
  context, such as conversation starters.
- Posting low quality LLM generated content and inviting debate.

Accounts engaging in this behavior may follow and interact with each other to
appear more legitimate. The same actor will often have accounts on multiple
instances.

## What is the risk?

People use social media looking for genuine interactions with others, and
being targetted by engagement farmers feels fake and unsatisfying.

Engagement farming is also a common first step before engaging in other bad
behavior, such as scamming or spamming, where an account that has gained
followers will have more success because of its visibility.

## Is user-level moderation sufficient?

Due to the risks involved and the likelihood of block evasion, the
use of personal blocklists may not be sustainable. Acting at a server level
reduces the work for many individuals.
