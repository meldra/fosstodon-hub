## What does it look like?

Harassment can be very subjective, especially on a text-based medium like a
social media place. It can also involve direct interactions or indirect
communications such as libel.

Overt harassment is generally easy to identify; it is often hostile in nature
and quite often shares features with other scenarios, such as
[doxing](/handbook/doxing) or [bigotry](/handbook/bigotry). You should
consider harassment to be very serious if it involves crossover with those
scenarios.

Some harassment may be more insidious and hard to spot. It can be someone
constantly interacting with specific people in a way that makes those people
or observers reasonably uncomfortable. This commonly involves tactics such as
[Sealioning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sealioning) to manipulate how those
interactions appear to onlookers. When called out, they will often use
[DARVO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DARVO) tactics to avoid accountability.

Commonly, harassing behavior is the result of miscommunication and a lack of
respect for boundaries, rather than malicious intent. This often requires
moderator attention and some kind of intervention, especially if both the
victim and the harasser get upset at each other.

## What is the risk?

Continuing to host an account that is known to engage in harassment will make
the community less enjoyable and cause people to feel unsafe.

## Is user-level moderation sufficient?

Usually no.

If the situation calms down and and and the harasser is not evading blocks,
then users may be able to manage the problem with their account tools.
However, they should not be expected to do so.

If you are reasonably sure you are dealing with non-malicious harassment,
start with warnings.
