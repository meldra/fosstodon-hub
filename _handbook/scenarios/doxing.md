## What does it look like?

Doxing is more complicated than someone announcing a person's street address
and phone number. Sometimes it is accidental and as little as using a wrong
name and  connecting two identities without the person's consent. While it
often features as part of harassment, sometimes it is just carelessness.

## What is the risk?

Doxing can result in real-life harm and can jeopardize the safety of the
individual whose information is leaked.

## Is user-level moderation sufficient?

No.

It should always be fixed in the same way; unpublishing the details as soon
as possible.

Once you have done that, you can decide with the rest of the mod team as to
the user's motive and whether to escalate your action.
