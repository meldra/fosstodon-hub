## What does it look like?

People and organizations use social media for all kinds of fundraising. We
sadly live in a world where crowdfunding is the only option for some causes.

Most groups and people who do fundraising posts do them infrequently, which is
not generally a problem.

## What is the risk?

Generally there is no risk in allowing people to post occasional fundraising
or mutual aid request posts.

An account that is exclusively about fundraising that is not relevant to the
topic of the community can make the community less enjoyable. People may
become emotionally exhausted from seeing constant requests to contribute,
and they may stop using the instance to avoid it.

## Is user-level moderation sufficient?

When the the posts are infrequent and the fundraiser is not evading blocks,
then users can manage the problem with their account tools.

If the posts are frequent enough for regular complaints, and appearing from
multiple different instances, then instance-level moderation may be needed.
