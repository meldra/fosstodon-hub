## What does it look like?

Hashtag spam involves a huge number of hashtags on posts that are typically
[advertising](/handbook/advertising) or [engagement farming](/handbook/farming).
The post content often has little to do with most of the included hashtags,
but this allows the spammer to get the same content to appear on a lot of
different feeds which they may think is useful for SEO.

Sometimes the hashtag spam is a once off, or the user trying a new thing, and
will stop if there is pushback.

## What is the risk?

Being bombarded with irrelevant content when trying to find specific content,
such as by browsing hashtags, can cause users to believe the platform is
broken or full of spam and they may avoid using the platform in the future.

## Is user-level moderation sufficient?

Due to the number of tags involved, and the likelihood of block evasion, the
use of personal blocklists may not be sustainable. Acting at a server level
reduces the work for many individuals.
