Hi, hello, welcome!

You are likely here because you are interested in moderation policies
for the Fosstodon.org server, part of the federated social web.

Our policies here are based on our two foundational documents, which
define how we operate as a social website.

* [The Code of Conduct](https://hub.fosstodon.org/coc)

  This document guides the users of Fosstodon.org and defines the
  expectations we have for conduct of our user membership. That means
  that the *people holding accounts on Fosstodon* are bound to this
  document as the service's de-facto Acceptable Use Policy (AUP).

  These are local server rules. They are not intended to define the
  behavior of external users. Local users are still welcome to report
  external content that is unsafe for the consideration of the
  moderation team, but are also expected to make use of the feed
  management tools available to them directly for minor annoyances and
  disagreements.

* [The Team Covenant](https://hub.fosstodon.org/covenant)

  This document outlines the expectations of the moderation processes on
  Fosstodon. These are the values that the moderation team commits to
  upholding, and as such, the guidance in this resource intends to reflect
  these values.
